- What are modules?
  **Modules can be described as a collection of code in an external file which performs a specific task or function.**
  模块可以被描述为执行特定任务或功能的外部文件中的代码集合
  **Modules allow the developer to organize their code and separate things like helper functions and external classes from the applications main logic.**

- What is the difference between named and default imports?

- What is the difference between named and default exports?
  **Unlike default exports, a module can have multiple named exports since they all have their own unique names.**
  Named exports and imports maintain the name of the entity being exported from one module and imported into another.命名导出和导入维护从一个模块导出并导入到另一个模块的实体的名称。 **Each module can have one default export.** a default export allows the content of what is being exported to be named in the file which is importing it.
  **export default is used before the function definition**
  this exports the component as a default entity 这会将组件导出为默认实体
