## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the `async` and `await` keywords used for?
  The **await** keyword is used to indicate that the JavaScript Runtime should **"wait" or "pause" until the asynchronous function completes.**

- How do `async` and `await` differ from `Promise.then` and `Promise.catch`?
  With async and await, the code is read sequentially.shines when asynchronous functions are chained
- When do you use `async`?

- When do you use `await`?
  We use the await keyword to **pause execution until the Promise returned** is either fulfilled or rejected.

When do you _not_ use `await`? (What happens if you `await` a synchronous function?)

- How do you handle errors with `await`?

- What do `try`, `catch` and `throw` do? When do you use them?
  We can even use a try...catch block for **error handling**, exactly as we would if the code were synchronous.
- What happens if you forget to use `await` on a Promise? In that case, what happens to the Promise rejection?
  it will execute the next block of code without the data

  await forces asynchronous operations to be completed in series. This is necessary if the result of the **next operation depends on the result of the last one,** but if that's not the case then something like Promise.all() will be more performant.

- Which style of asynchronous programming do you prefer â€” callbacks, `Promise.then`, or `async/await`? Why?

Promise.then
