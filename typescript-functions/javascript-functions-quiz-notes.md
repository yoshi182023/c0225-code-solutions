## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  There are usually two main types of functions. Functions that return a value, or functions that just do something or perform some sort of operation but we don't necessarily care about the return value
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  Arrow functions were added to the JavaScript language with ES6 (ES2015). They provide a nice shorthand for passing functions as parameters to other functions.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The function keyword to begin the creation of a new fu (Our function's name is sayHello.)
  A comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, surrounded by () parentheses.
  The start of the function's code block, as indicated by an { opening curly brace.

  The end of the function's code block, as indicated by a } closing curly brace.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  execute again and again by name without having to copy-paste the code inside.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  parameter is a placeholder. It is a variable whose value is not known until we call the function and pass an argument.
  when we define a function, we declare parameters and that when we call a function, we pass it arguments.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  parameter will be holding the value of the argument.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  return does two things for us:
  Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
  Prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.

- **What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?**
  **function keyword is not used and an arrow [=>] is used between the parameter list and code block.** The => is why this type of function is called an arrow function.

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  **arrow functions have an implicit return when curly braces {} are not used to contain the function's code block.**
