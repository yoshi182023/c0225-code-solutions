## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Give 6 examples of comparison operators.
  Equal (==): Returns true if the operands are equal.
  Not equal (!=): Returns true if the operands are not equal.
  Strict equal (===): Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type.
  Strict not equal (!==): Returns true if the operands are not equal or not of the same type.
  Greater than (>): Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
  Less than (<): Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.

- What data type do comparison expressions evaluate to?
  Boolean

- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?
  an expression needs to go inside so that there is a condition that our code is checking for.

- Is `else` required in order to use an `if` statement?
  no, optional.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of an `if` statement.
  if (boolean expression) {
  **// Code block that executes if the conditional evaluates to true**
  }

- What are the three logical operators?
  **Logical operators are useful for combining or inverting conditions.**
- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?

- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?

**Switch statements are useful for when there is a collection of conditions or cases that need to be checked against.** This could technically also be done via an else/if statement, but the switch statement makes it a bit more readable and user-friendly.

- **Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?**

**default clause is optional.** A default clause can technically be omitted, but it's a nice way to handle a final catch all in case any previous clauses did not execute.
