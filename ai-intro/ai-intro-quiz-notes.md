## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?

We doubt that AI will replace coders, but we believe that coders who use AI will replace those who donâ€™t.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  Do not use any code generation until you know how to code well enough that you can detect when the tools make mistakes. Do not use AI tools to generate code until you finish your LearningFuze projects.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?

It can generate code that is hard to understand or use, it can generate code that is incorrect, it can even generate code that has bugs or does not run. Until you know enough to tell the difference, you should not use code generation at all.
